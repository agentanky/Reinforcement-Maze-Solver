Emerging Trends

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
Code Provided:
In this project, I was given several pieces of starter code which included:

TreasureEnvironment.py: This file contained the complete code for the environment, including the maze setup, the pirate's movements, reward calculation, and state updates.
GameExperience.py: This file provided the code for managing experience replay, including storing episodes and retrieving data for training.
Neural Network Model: The Jupyter notebook included code to build the neural network model used for training the pirate agent.

Code Created:
I was responsible for implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm to train the pirate agent. This involved:

Q-Training Algorithm: Completing the Q-training section in the Jupyter notebook, where I developed the deep Q-learning algorithm.
Logging and Monitoring: Incorporating logging mechanisms to track the training progress, loss values, and other relevant metrics.
Batch Updates and Prioritized Experience Replay: Implementing batch updates and prioritized experience replay to stabilize training and improve performance.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve problems using technology. They write programs, develop algorithms, and create systems that can process information and perform tasks. Their work is essential because it powers everything from smartphones to medical equipment and even space missions. For example, the algorithms developed by computer scientists help us find the quickest route on a GPS, diagnose diseases using medical data, and even predict weather patterns.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Understand the Problem: Clearly define what needs to be solved. For instance, in the pirate agent project, the problem was finding the treasure in the maze.
Plan a Solution: Design an approach or algorithm to solve the problem. In our project, this meant planning how the pirate agent would learn the best path.
Implement the Solution: Write the code to execute the plan. We implemented the Q-learning algorithm in our project.
Test and Debug: Run the solution, test it to find any issues, and fix those problems. We ran many simulations to ensure our pirate agent worked correctly.
Optimize: Make the solution more efficient and faster if possible. For the pirate agent, this involved improving the learning algorithm.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Accuracy and Reliability: Ensure that the software you create works correctly and reliably. Mistakes in software can lead to serious issues, such as errors in medical diagnoses or financial calculations.
Privacy and Security: Protect users' data from being misused or stolen. This means implementing strong security measures and respecting users' privacy.
Transparency: Make sure users understand how your software works, especially if it makes important decisions. This helps build trust and allows users to use the software safely and effectively.
Fairness: Ensure that your software does not discriminate against any group of people. This involves testing and refining algorithms to avoid biases.
